# Fulgun Data Types

Data type is an important concept in programming. Data type specifies the size and type of variable values.

Falgun is statically typed, meaning that once a variable type is defined, it can only store data of that type.

Falgun supports several data types:

- `Boolean`: This type represents a boolean value that can be either `true` or `false`. It's typically used for conditions and toggles.
- `Integer`: This type represents an integer value, which is a whole number without a fractional component.
- `Float`: This type represents a floating-point number, which is a number that has a decimal point.
- `String`: This type represents a sequence of characters. It's used for text and can include letters, numbers, and symbols.
- `enum`: This type represents an enumeration, which is a distinct type consisting of a set of named constants called the enumerator list.
- `Array`: This type represents a collection of elements. Each element in an array can be of any type, and each one is identified by an index.
- `Function`: This type represents a function. In Falgun, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned from other functions.


## Boolean Data Type

A boolean data type is declared with the `bool` keyword and can only take the values `true` or `false`.

The default value of a boolean data type is `false`.

This example shows some different ways to declare Boolean variables:
```js

// typed declaration without initial value
let b1: bool 

// typed declaration with initial value
let b2: bool = true 

// untyped declaration with initial value
let b3 = true

// untyped declaration with initial value
b4 := true 
```

## Integer Data Types
Integer data types are used to store a whole number without decimals, like 35, -50, or 1345000.

The integer data type has two categories:
- `Signed integers` - can store both positive and negative values
- `Unsigned integers` - can only store non-negative values

`Tip`: The default type for integer is `int`. If you do not specify a type, the type will be `int`.

### Signed Integers
Signed integers, declared with one of the `int` keywords, can store both positive and negative values:

```js
// Declare an integer variable named 'x' and assign it the value 500
let x: int = 500;

// Declare a variable named 'y', infer its type from the value, and assign it the value -4500
let y = -4500;
```

Falgun has five keywords/types of signed integers:

| Type  | Size | Range |
|-------|------|-------|
| int   | Depends on platform: 32 bits in 32 bit systems and 64 bit in 64 bit systems | -2147483648 to 2147483647 in 32 bit systems and -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807 in 64 bit systems |
| int8  | 8 bits/1 byte | -128 to 127 |
| int16 | 16 bits/2 bytes | -32768 to 32767 |
| int32 | 32 bits/4 bytes | -2147483648 to 2147483647 |
| int64 | 64 bits/8 bytes | -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807 |

### Unsigned Integers
Unsigned integers, declared with one of the `uint` keywords, can only store non-negative values:



```js
// Declare an unsigned integer variable named 'x' and assign it the value 500
let x: uint = 500;
```

Falgun has five keywords/types of unsigned integers:

| Type   | Size | Range |
|--------|------|-------|
| uint   | Depends on platform: 32 bits in 32 bit systems and 64 bit in 64 bit systems | 0 to 4294967295 in 32 bit systems and 0 to 18446744073709551615 in 64 bit systems |
| uint8  | 8 bits/1 byte | 0 to 255 |
| uint16 | 16 bits/2 bytes | 0 to 65535 |
| uint32 | 32 bits/4 bytes | 0 to 4294967295 |
| uint64 | 64 bits/8 bytes | 0 to 18446744073709551615 |


## Float Data Types

The float data types are used to store positive and negative numbers with a decimal point, like 35.3, -2.34, or 3597.34987.

The float data type has three keywords:

| Type    | Size      | Range                  |
|---------|-----------|------------------------|
| float   | Depends on platform: 32 bits in 32 bit systems and 64 bit in 64 bit systems | -3.4e+38 to 3.4e+38 in 32 bit systems and -1.7e+308 to +1.7e+308 in 64 bit systems |
| float32 | 32 bits   | -3.4e+38 to 3.4e+38    |
| float64 | 64 bits   | -1.7e+308 to +1.7e+308 |

### Example

```js
// Declare a float variable and assign it a value
let a: float = 3.14;

// Declare a float32 variable and assign it a value
let b: float32 = 3.14;

// Declare a float64 variable and assign it a value
let c: float64 = 3.14;
```

Tip: The default type for floating-point numbers in Falgun is `float`. If you do not specify a type when declaring a floating-point number, the type will be `float`. For example:

```js
// The type of PI is `float` because no type was specified
const PI = 3.14; 
```

## String Data Types
```rust
let greeting: string = "Hello, World!";
```

## enum Data Types
```rust
enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue
}
let myColor: Color = Color.Green;
```

## Array Data Types

```rust
let numbers: int[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```
